# 7tv-to-cytube-emotes
A little script to fetch 7tv emote sets, format them for cytube and export them.

Just replace the end of the url with the id of the emote set and run it with python (py fetcher.py)
Then go to CyTube > Channel Settings > Edit > Emotes > paste it at the bottom and click Import emote list
